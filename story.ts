In 2011, we met in an unlikely way at an unlikely place: a math class!
I saw Sydney in the CHAMP program classroom and instantly sat down next to her.
Over the course of the year, we’d get to know each other a bit better.
I’m sure our conversation wasn’t riveting as awkward teenagers, but I could tell she was special.
I remember telling my brother all about her. And I’m so glad she saw something special in me.

In 2012, I ended up not sticking around for the second year of CHAMP.
But to my surprise and joy, Sydney and I kept in touch!
I had given her my email on a slip of paper the year before, so we first connected over email and then began texting back and forth.
As a nervous freshman anxious about everything high school related, Sydney grounded me and affirmed me in unspoken ways.
Texting her was undoubtedly the highlight of my day.

In 2013, after much delay, I finally summoned the courage to ask her out!
I had convinced myself that I was unfit to be her date previously. I was petrified of letting her down.
But out of nowhere, something inside of me - the nudge of God - broke down those lies and took the plunge.
I asked if she wanted to see my high school’s performance of Peter Pan later that day.
Despite my short-notice request, she said yes!!
The play was mediocre, the stage set fell over twice, and I didn’t say everything I wanted to because of interruptions from friends.
But it was a date nonetheless! And a happy one because it was with Syd. I do remember us laughing thankfully during the intermission.
So it wasn’t a total bust after all. Besides, she decided to see me again! That was our first date, on Nov 16 2013.

In 2014, not only did we continue our romance, but it took on a whole new meaning as my life was forever altered by God.
We shared our first Valentine’s Day and were often seen enjoying movies at the theater together.
We shared our first dance at a wintertime homecoming and could be spotted holding hands.
If you’re curious who kissed who first, I’ll fill you in: she kissed me!
We continued to enjoy spending time together; it was less about the “what” of our dates and always about the “who”: confident, stunning, thoughtful Sydney.
And then, after a few months of joining her youth group for romantic reasons, I went on a retreat.
Catholic men inspired me through their response to God's will in their vocations. Songs lifted my awkward soul out of its shell.
And the sacraments were shown to me in their full splendor, culminating in an overpowering moment of closeness with God.
I received an inspired message about my vocation and broke down in joy.
I was called to marriage and to serve Sydney as much as I am able to with the grace of God!
From then on, our relationship meant so much more.

In 2015, Sydney and I were faced with a challenge: dating long distance.
The year however began with incredible news: Sydney had gotten into Univ. of Notre Dame! I wasn’t surprised in the slightest.
But I remained back home completing my senior year of high school.
And so, since we were committed to each other, we Skyped more times than I can count.
Our Skype calling really helped bridge the physical distance we were experiencing.
And it also made painfully clear how much we took seeing each other in person for granted!
But at the end of a long day studying and learning, we took solace in being able to see each other faces and ramble on with stories and pray when while apart.

`
In 2016, I joined Sydney at Notre Dame!
My randomly assigned roommates (Chris, Jacob, and Tim - you might recognize some of those names) instantly accepted me.
Right away, I was submerged into the ocean of traditions not only of my college dorm Dillon but the entire campus at large.
That includes setting aside all of Saturday for Game Day!
Learning the Alma Mater and every chant, both the family-friendly and explicit ones.
Or attending the beautiful liturgy of a Basilica Mass or the community-oriented Thursday Dillon Mass with milkshakes afterwards.
I only ate at South dining hall, never North, and I began to make friends down the hall from me through the medium of couch games.
Still unsure of my path, I picked up physics as a major, but would soon after discover coding over winter break and make a 180 for computer science.
All in all, it was exciting, new, adventurous, and most importantly, such a joy to be there with Sydney!

`
In 2017, Syd and I were swept off our feet by the wonders of our study abroad semester.
I could say much about our adventure, but I’ll try to be brief! Notre Dame set us students up with a Villa in downtown Rome.
We took the tram to classes, the metro to a school where we taught English, and a bus... actually no one trusts the buses to ever be on time!
While still on a budget, Sydney and I took trips to France, Germany, Poland, or elsewhere in gorgeous, culture-rich Italy.
But the crowning jewel of our time there was our visit to San Potito Sannitico, the small Italian village of Syd’s distant relatives.
It all began with Sydney’s dad’s passionate efforts to find their family’s current day descendants.
At long last, we made contact, and her many times removed cousin Nicola told us to come on over!
Nicola and family picked us up from the small train station and drove us tens of miles into the countryside, eventually arriving at their small village beneath a stunning mountain.
Their entire family hosted us at their home then threw an entire feast in our honor.
Never have I had more trouble eating everything given to me! We met everyone, danced with everyone, and were blown away by their generosity.
If we admired a painting on the wall, they offered to give it to us!
As a beautiful summary of their kindness, right before hopping on the train home, Nicola gave his own coat to me - the boyfriend of his far distant cousin.
Nicola, Rosella, Fabio, and Michela showed us such love.

`
In 2018, I asked Sydney to marry me. I’ll spoil the surprise... I’m sure you’re aware: she said yes!
What was happening meanwhile? Sydney and I were wrapping up undergrad together.
I can confidently say she was working harder than me, she had an entire thesis to finish!
So how did I ask? It was our five year anniversary and we attended a friday Mass at the basilica.
For weeks leading up to our anniversary, I continued to throw her off and convince her I wasn’t proposing.
I can’t believe I did it though, because Syd is an expert sleuth! So I told Syd we were going out to dinner. 
But on the way there, I suggested that we stop in to the off campus church to pray, the one where Sydney does kids’ Sunday catechesis.
She agreed, and just “by chance” the church was unlocked and we could walk in!
Meanwhile, my awesome roommates James and Chris had setup an array of candles we designed in the shape of the sacred heart of Jesus.
Sydney was speechless. We knelt at the altar. I said a prayer of gratitude, breaking down in tears.
And then I whispered “You should probably stand up now...!” We both laughed and I proposed at last!
Behind her crying, I heard her “yes.”
Our night ended with a fun pasta dinner we prepared together and a surprise party waiting at her dorm room.
What a special moment, thank you God and thank you friends!

`
In 2019, Sydney and I began the next chapters of our work vocations.
During the summer, I decided to turn down a return internship offer in hopes of a better company.
My wish was granted! And Sydney, now graduated with her Bachelors, began her time in Echo.
Only a few hours away from me at Notre Dame, she lived with amazing roommates Claire and Marissa to serve the Church in the Joliet diocese.
The whole year was a series of growth opportunities for both of us.
Sydney had to navigate an entirely new job at the parish complete with ever changing asks.
I had to navigate a whole new company that summer with new technology and people to work with and meet.
But in the end, we gained such good experience and became far more prepared for our careers.
And along the way, we made such incredible life long friends!

`
In 2020, we stayed home like everyone else. The year got off to a strong start if you can believe it.
I moved into a short term apartment in downtown Chicago and walked every weekday to my new full-time software position.
On weekends, I could easily visit Sydney and her incredible Echo community (Marissa, Claire) by taking a train to the burbs.
I was thrilled to be only an hour away! But then, COVID happened. Nothing I could say hasn’t been said before.
But let’s just say I was lucky to work for a grocery giant and lucky to have a job easily transitioned to work from home.
Jacob, my college roommate, coworker, and best man, took me in. His family made me feel like their fourth son.
Eventually, stay at home was lifted, and Jacob and I secured a year long condo lease until the month of my wedding with Syd.
While I enjoyed being back together with my amazing roommate, I struggled to be so distant from Sydney.
I thought long distance was over! But instead, week by week one of us was exposed to the virus, and seeing each other remained infrequent throughout the year.
In fact, for our 7 year anniversary in November, I watched and waved and called Sydney from the sidewalk, while she looked at me from her bedroom window.
It was a difficult year like this for everyone. Despite this, I remained so thankful for many glimmers of hope.
The Catholic church’s availability of COVID-safe sacraments in Chicago.
Celebrating our birthdays and Christmas breaks in person with small groups of loved ones.
And getting to know actually genuine, kind neighbors in Chicago: those sleeping outside your grocery store rather than next-door to you.

2021 is upon us, and I’m optimistic about the future!

Sydney and I have both received our vaccines, we're putting a down payment on a house, and 
we're about to be married... there is much to be thankful for. 

Thanks for tuning in to this timeline of these last 10 years. :)

To all the people who supported us along the way, from friends to family, thank you.
